    Established by Thomas Burberry in 1856, Burberry combines our founder’s passion for the outdoors with modern British design. 

As a 21-year-old former draper’s apprentice, Thomas Burberry noticed that people struggled with heavy, uncomfortable outerwear when braving the British weather. He had a vision – to create a breathable fabric that would enable people to move freely. Twenty-three years after founding Burberry, Thomas achieved his vision with the revolutionary invention of gabardine in 1879.

    Continuously pushing creative boundaries, Burberry innovated to protect explorers and pioneers. 

    In 1893, Dr Fridtjof Nansen, a Norwegian polar explorer, zoologist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, became the first recorded polar explorer to wear and utilise Burberry’s innovative fabrics in the Arctic Circle. This pioneering spirit continued when in the early 20th century, acclaimed British Explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton wore Burberry gabardine for three expeditions. 

This legacy of exploration keeps outdoor inspiration at the forefront of our designs. Our house signatures, from the trench coat and Burberry Check to the Equestrian Knight Design, reflect this adventurous heritage.

<p class="trench1">Made in the UK,
    the Trench
    The trench is the cornerstone of Burberry. Made from gabardine, a shower-resistant fabric invented by Thomas Burberry, our
    Heritage Trench and Car Coats are crafted in Yorkshire and hand-finished by a team of specialist tailors.Our coats have been crafted from cotton gabardine and lined with the Burberry Check for more than a century. Todya, these iconic fabrics are woven at our mill in Keighley, Yorkshire.
    Every piece of gabardine is inspected by hand, ensuring perfection of colour and surface before the cutting of a single piece of fabric.
    from buttons to belt loops, details are stitched on by hand - the most intricate being the collar. Made up of eight parts and up to  200 stitches, it takes up to a year of training for each specialist tailor to master the fluid curve that allows the collar to sit perfectly on the neck.
    The Heritage Trench Coats are named after different London boroughs – each shape personifying its unique character.</p>
